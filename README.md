### Client-Side:

## Quick Start

### Running on local environment.

1. First, apply a personal firebase, stripe account.
2. Enter below cmd:

#### `nodemon`

If you want to modify the client side parts, please enter the client
and enter below cmd:

#### `npm start`.

3. Back-end part:
    We use Express.js to build the back-end. 

4. GraphQL part:
    Due to the system-design issues, we have to build unique server for GraphQL server--- as you may know, the most powerful part of GraphQL is to use it as a middleware and fetch data from different datasource! (e.g. mySQL, Oracle,local storage...)
